# make-config

This is just a copy of my GNU Make configuration I use on many projects that I've put here so I can more easily share it with others.
Feel free to use
as-is, modify it, or just mine it for ideas.

Basically this just configures GNU Make to operate with much better defaults, taking us a few tiny steps closer to having a decent build tool.

Using this essentially requires:
- A modern version of GNU Make.
- A decent understanding of Make.
