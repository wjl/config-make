# config.mk

This is a copy of the GNU Make configuration I've used on dozens of projects that I've put here so I can more easily share it with others.
Feel free to use as-is, modify it, or just mine it for ideas.

Basically this just configures GNU Make to operate with **much** better defaults, making it much more of a pleasure to use.

Using this essentially requires:
- A modern version of GNU Make.
- A decent understanding of Make.
